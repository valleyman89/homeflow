  "short_description": "A unique opportunity to acquire this impressive five-bedroom home (with a 2-bedroom annex) situated in one of the largest plots in the local area.\n\nThe house comprises of 5748 sq.ft., of particular note is the impressive double reception room complemented by a lovely orangery boasting great views over the landscaped rear garden. There is a large kitchen/family room on the lower ground floor with a spacious wine cellar and a separate utility room. \n\nThe house offers flexible accommodation with a separate coach house to the side over a large double garage. The current owner uses the whole house but it could easily be more formally separated to create a self-contained annex, with its own kitchenette and bathroom. In the main house there are five double bedrooms offering excellent family accommodation and three bathrooms. \nTo the rear, there is a wonderful mature landscaped rear garden with an outdoor swimming pool and pool house. Perfectly placed to catch the sun all day.\n\nThere are also double gates leading to Amerland Road with overflowing parking for three extra cars and therefore great potential to develop the rear garden subject to consent from the local authority. To the front of the house there is parking for three cars.\n\nWest Hill Road is a short walk from the amenities and transport links of both Putney and Wandsworth Town. Additionally, Clapham Junction is a short bus ride. The A3 is approached via West Hill. Wandsworth Park is situated nearby with its open spaces and river walks.\n",

  "short_description": "SOLE AGENT. Carteret House is situated in one of the finest coastal locations on Jersey's North East coast, enjoying a commanding cliff-top position above the idyllic fishing harbour of Rozel. The house offers views of the protected native woodland with a private winding pathway leading down to a rocky cove. Far-reaching views of the French coast provide a dramatic backdrop to the reef of Les Ecrehous. Cleverly offering a contemporary look with the enduring pleasure of absolute quality of concept, high-end appliances, the latest technology and materials, and spectacular workmanship. The building specification exceeds current market expectations ensuring an easily maintained environment with all of the modern day conveniences. Upon entering, you are welcomed by an impressive entrance hall with a bespoke staircase leading to a half landing with a glimpse through to a magnificent wine cave. The ground floor reception space is vast with a dining room, living room, kitchen/breakfast room, butler/catering kitchen with larder, cinema room and office. All of the sea facing rooms benefit from large windows and doors leading out onto an extensive terrace. The 5 bedrooms suites upstairs are not compromised either with fabulous en-suite bathrooms and sea views as far as the eye can see. The delight of the lower ground floor is the seamless transition between the inside and the outside; sliding windows gliding back to link the two. The space can be accessed from the kitchen offering a vast leisure suite with changing rooms and bar/entertaining facilities. The 2.8-acre grounds consist of lovely manicured lawns with mature borders, various terraced areas that enjoy the sweeping sea views, infinity swimming pool with sunken seating area, and an enclosed parking forecourt for numerous cars. If all of this wasn't enough, there is a detached 6-car garage block with staff/guest accommodation above which is cleverly connected to the main house by a spacious glazed passage.",

  "short_description": "SOLD SUBJECT TO CONTRACT A truly magnificent, detached double fronted family house combining period elegance and modern convenience.\nThis lovely late 19th century house features impressive interconnecting rooms which are ideal for both family living and large scale entertaining.\n\nThere is a luxuriant sense of space throughout the property. The ground floor has been extended to 3,572 sq. ft. and includes four principle reception rooms. \n\nOn arriving, there is a large entrance hall, bracketed by a grand central staircase. To the left, the drawing room leads through folding doors to an elegant dining room which comfortably seats 12-14.  Both rooms have matching original mouldings and large working fireplaces with striking marble surrounds. The spacious family room is delightfully bright and adaptable to a variety of uses.  \nA stunning Marston & Langinger conservatory with Moroccan floor tiles runs along the rear of the house, where three sets of French doors lead onto the landscaped garden.\nThe octagonal kitchen with cathedral ceiling is of a very high quality with Gaggenau and Miele appliances. Six tall windows facing onto the garden are designed to take maximum advantage of the abundant light and space.  An adjacent room is a convenient homework/hobby room and includes the original early 19th century wall to wall glass fronted china and crystal cabinet.   \n\nCompleting the ground floor is a study and cloakroom.  The ground floor also leads onto a double garage with stairs leading to a self-contained studio/gym (with access to plumbing if staff accommodation is desired).\n\nOn the upper floors is the master bedroom which overlooks the garden with en-suite shower room and dressing area. There are five further double bedrooms, all of very good size, with access to two family bathrooms plus a separate WC.  There is also a second study and significant storage built in.\nThe west facing garden is a real oasis for London.  Designer landscaped, the garden boasts mature trees and shrubs including exotic palms which lend an almost tropical air. There is a tiered flagstone terrace with a quite extraordinary marble table for al fresco entertaining.  A secluded summerhouse and fountain with fish pond complete this sanctuary.\nThe house is located on the favoured west side of Gwendolen Avenue, a tree lined street which many call Putney's premier address. The property is only a short walk to Putney mainline and East Putney underground stations giving easy and flexible access to Central London and it is also near many highly desirable schools.\n\n                              SOLD",

  "short_description": "Marylebone Square is a rare opportunity to be part of the provenance of aristocratic estates in Central London. A contemporary take on a classic London mansion, it is an intuitively designed building that slots into the urban fabric of Marylebone.\n\nThis apartment offers three bedrooms and four bathrooms, in this fantastic location. \n\nSet over five floors, Marylebone Square houses just 54 one to three bedroom apartments. All apartments have been designed from a central atrium which is the centrepiece of the building and allows for every apartment to have dual aspect.\n\nThe residences are refined, elegant and intuitively designed; each apartment is generously spacious yet warmly intimate.\n\nCreated by developers, Concord London and Simon Bowden Architects, all residences benefit from floor-to-ceiling windows and glass sliding doors giving each space a bright and capacious feel. Additional features include 24 hour concierge service.\n\nMarylebone Square has an estimated completion of 2021 and complies with a 10 year build warranty by NHBC.",
